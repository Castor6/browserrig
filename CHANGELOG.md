# BrowserRig

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2a33968: Ship BrowserRig as an installable DeepSeek Harness bundle with native,
  session-isolated browser tools, built-in operating guidance, and a
  self-contained package-local CLI runtime.

BrowserRig is an independent, MIT-licensed fork of
`@opencode-ai/browser-control`. The upstream changelog is retained below as
project lineage; those entries describe upstream releases, not BrowserRig
release claims.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Establish the independent BrowserRig package, CLI, MCP command, extension
  artifact, local state namespace, and agent skill.
- Pin the independent Chrome Web Store draft's public manifest key and Item ID
  instead of trusting the upstream publisher's extension origin.
- Attach and adopt the active tab in the user's last-focused Chrome window
  without a toolbar click or Chrome's browser-wide remote-debugging approval
  dialog, while retaining manual multi-tab attachment and the complete driver.

### Patch Changes

- Fall back from automatic tab capture to CDP for silent recordings when a
  no-click adopted tab lacks Chrome's temporary capture grant. Explicit tab
  capture and audio requests still require the user gesture.
- Re-adopt a detached user tab without replacing the session's default page or
  surfacing a stale page-recovery warning.
- Fail closed when a positional snapshot ref drifts to a different same-role
  element after DOM insertion.
- Ship npm dual-use metadata and a concrete disclosure, with release candidates
  prepared for maintainer-reviewed 2FA publishing instead of direct OIDC.
- Pin the Effect runtime and its Node adapter to one compatible prerelease line,
  and declare the Node.js versions required by their dependency graph so clean
  npm installs cannot silently mix incompatible Effect releases.
- Derive packaged CLI build IDs from release inputs instead of wall-clock time
  and normalize gzip's informational source-OS byte, making npm packs
  byte-for-byte reproducible across supported release hosts.

# Upstream history: @opencode-ai/browser-control

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 05b068d: Stream tab-capture recordings to disk with intrinsically framed, sequenced binary messages instead of buffering complete recordings in relay memory.

### Patch Changes

- 05b068d: Isolate CDP client state so concurrent clients retain their own auto-attach
  settings, invalidate target aliases when ownership hides a tab, reject hidden
  session routing, avoid arbitrary target fallback, and detach child targets when
  their root disappears. Centralize target and alias routing so stale root and
  child sessions fail closed.
- 05b068d: Accept `--session`, `-s`, and `BROWSER_CONTROL_SESSION` for session reset and
  delete while retaining positional and current-session selection.
- 05b068d: Prepare an unlisted Chrome Web Store extension with protocol-based relay
  compatibility, deterministic packaging, and more reliable cold-start target
  creation. Session reset and delete now recover relay-owned targets whose
  debugger attachment was permanently lost during an extension update.
- d0285d9: Allow release builds to connect to the exact unpacked extension bundled with
  the installed package while continuing to reject arbitrary extension origins.
- 05b068d: Search recursively through open shadow roots in `fillInput` and `fillInputs`,
  and report the closed-root boundary when a selector has no match.
- fcacf49: Prevent snapshot refs from timing out when a page's accessible name differs slightly from Browser Control's compact display name.
- 05b068d: Preserve page focus while `fillInput` and `fillInputs` update controlled fields,
  preventing focus-sensitive extensions from making the target unresponsive.
- 05b068d: Keep the Chrome extension connected across idle service-worker suspension, repair missing reconnect alarms whenever the worker starts, start the managed relay correctly when MCP runs through a package-manager bin symlink, and make Doctor compare the runtime extension with the manifest shipped in the npm package.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 4699f7d: Pin production WebSocket access to the assigned Chrome Web Store extension ID
  while retaining an explicit source-development path for unpacked extensions.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- abfcabb: Prepare an unlisted Chrome Web Store extension with protocol-based relay
  compatibility, deterministic packaging, and more reliable cold-start target
  creation. Session reset and delete now recover relay-owned targets whose
  debugger attachment was permanently lost during an extension update.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 7aee5fd: Add a public Effect client with atomic named sessions and schema-decoded, same-origin JSON requests authenticated by the live browser page. Sensitive responses are returned as `Redacted` values and bypass execute journals and active network captures.

### Patch Changes

- 7aee5fd: Add `BrowserControlClient.reveal` for consuming sensitive authenticated responses across package-manager layouts with separate Effect runtime instances, plus `resetSession` for recovering disconnected named sessions without invoking the CLI.
- 7aee5fd: Reorganize the Browser Control agent skill around an inspect-act-verify golden
  path, explicit completion criteria, and concise optional workflows.
- 4427f40: Allow cold managed relays up to ten seconds to restore persisted sessions and
  become ready before reporting startup failure.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8ffa89c: Add session-scoped authenticated network capture, credential-redacted HAR
  exports, stable reusable secret profiles, credential refresh, and redacted
  command execution across CLI, MCP, and the execute sandbox.

### Patch Changes

- 3ba9951: Persist named session identity and exact target ownership across relay process
  restarts while clearly resetting process-local JavaScript state and snapshot
  references. Allow handoffs to register before starting actions that may block on
  native WebAuthn or payment prompts.
- edf33c2: Reject stale relays before operational CLI and MCP calls, preserve sessions
  across same-tab target and execution-context replacement, retain bounded relay
  fault diagnostics, and safely escape snapshot attribute selectors.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 3729b6c: Rewrite the README around npm installation, agent skill and MCP setup, first-run workflows, and safety boundaries.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 161e420: Keep snapshot references stable across safe rerenders when a control has a unique class and accessible identity.
